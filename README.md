# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of classic machine learning algorithms written from scratch using only fundamental Python and numerical tools. The goal is to build a clear understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Linear Regression

### Overview
Linear regression models the relationship between one or more input features and a continuous target variable by fitting a linear function. It is typically trained by minimizing a loss function such as mean squared error.

### Implementation details
- Parameter initialization (weights and bias)
- Prediction function \( \hat{y} = Xw + b \)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Gradient computation for weights and bias
- Gradient descent optimization loop
- Train–test split for basic evaluation
